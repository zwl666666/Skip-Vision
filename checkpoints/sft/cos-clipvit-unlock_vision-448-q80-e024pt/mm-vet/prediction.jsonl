{"question_id": 214, "prompt": "The pie charts below show units of electricity production by fuel source in Australia and France in 1980 and 2000.\n\nSummarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.\n\nYou should write at least 150 words.", "text": "The image displays two pie charts, one for Australia and the other for France, showing the units of electricity production by fuel source in 1980 and 2000. The charts show a clear shift in the energy sources used for electricity production over the years.\n\nIn 1980, the majority of electricity production in Australia was generated from coal, with 60% of the units coming from this source. In contrast, France relied more on nuclear energy, with 50% of the units produced from this source. The remaining units were generated from natural gas and other sources.\n\nIn 2000, the picture has changed significantly. Australia has shifted towards a more diverse range of energy sources, with coal still being the dominant source, but also including natural gas, hydroelectric power, and other sources. France, on the other hand, has continued to rely heavily on nuclear energy, with 70% of the units produced from this source. The remaining units are generated from coal and other sources.\n\nThe comparison between the two countries highlights the shift in energy policies and the increasing focus on cleaner and more sustainable energy sources over time.", "answer_id": "dz34Atu8Ff2k8Ek84Nguh6", "model_id": "cos-clipvit-unlock_vision-448-q80-e024pt", "metadata": {}}

{"question_id": 217, "prompt": "The diagram below shows how the Australian Bureau of Meteorology collects up-to-the-minute information on the weather in order to produce reliable forecasts.\n\nWrite a report for a university lecturer describing the information shown below. \n\nYou should write at least 150 words.", "text": "The image depicts a detailed diagram of the Australian Bureau of Meteorology's process for collecting and analyzing weather data to produce accurate forecasts. The process begins with the collection of data from various sources, including satellites, radar, and other meteorological instruments. This information is then transmitted to the bureau's broadcast center, where it is analyzed and prepared for broadcasting.\n\nThe diagram shows that the data is first processed by a computer, which then generates a digital chart for the meteorologists to use. The chart displays the collected data in a visual format, allowing the meteorologists to quickly and easily understand the current weather conditions. The data is then used to create forecasts for the upcoming weather, which are broadcasted to the public through various media channels, such as television and radio.\n\nThe diagram also highlights the importance of the bureau's use of technology in collecting and analyzing weather data. The use of satellites and radar systems allows the bureau to gather information from a wide range of locations, ensuring that they have a comprehensive understanding of the current weather conditions. This information is then used to create accurate forecasts, which are crucial for the safety and well-being of the Australian public.", "answer_id": "FCYAdgGumWXh4xjG2gbnKu", "model_id": "cos-clipvit-unlock_vision-448-q80-e024pt", "metadata": {}}
