The migration rate then began to decline, with a slight dip in 2005, followed by a significant drop in 2006. The number of migrants continued to decrease in 2007, reaching around 20,000. However, in 2008, the migration rate increased slightly, with around 25,000 migrants.\n\nThe data suggests that the UK has experienced a fluctuating migration trend over the past decade, with periods of growth and decline. The peak migration rate in 2007 indicates a high demand for international workers in the UK during that time.", "answer_id": "Cj3FHsVraNNVmMVAvMxWy3", "model_id": "cos-clipvit-unlock_vision-448-q80", "metadata": {}}
{"question_id": 209, "prompt": "The graph and table below give information about water use worldwide and water consumption in two different countries.\n\nSummarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.\n\nYou should write at least 150 words.", "text": "The image displays a graph and a table that provide information about water use worldwide and water consumption in two different countries. The graph shows that the global water use has increased significantly over the years, with a notable spike in the 1980s. The table, on the other hand, shows that water consumption in Brazil and Congo has also increased over the years, with a more gradual increase in Congo compared to the steep increase in Brazil.\n\nComparing the two countries, it is evident that Brazil has a higher water consumption rate than Congo. In 2000, Brazil's water consumption was 1,500 cubic meters per person, while Congo's was 100 cubic meters per person. By 2020, Brazil's water consumption had increased to 1,800 cubic meters per person, while Congo's had increased to 150 cubic meters per person. This indicates that Brazil has a higher water consumption rate than Congo, and the gap between the two countries has widened over the years.\n\nThe graph and table also show that the global water use has increased significantly over the years, with a notable spike in the 1980s. This increase in water use can be attributed to various factors, such as population growth, industrialization, and urbanization. The increasing demand for water has led to the development of various water management strategies, such as water conservation, desalination, and water reuse. However, the increasing water use also poses significant challenges, such as water scarcity, water pollution, and climate change.", "answer_id": "VnGzjL93oBqwNCnCSeCZAn", "model_id": "cos-clipvit-unlock_vision-448-q80", "metadata": {}}

The first graph shows a significant decline in the number of marriages from 1970 to 2000, with a peak in the mid-1970s and a gradual decrease thereafter. The second graph shows a similar decline in the number of divorces, with a slight increase in the late 1990s.\n\nIn 1970, the number of marriages was around 8.2 million, while the number of divorces was around 1.2 million. By 2000, the number of marriages had decreased to around 4.7 million, and the number of divorces had increased to around 1.7 million.\n\nThe second graph shows the marital status of adult Americans in two different years. In 1970, the majority of adult Americans were married, with only around 10% being single. In 2000, the majority of adult Americans were single, with around 50% being married and around 40% being single.\n\nOverall, the graphs indicate a significant shift in societal attitudes towards marriage and divorce in the USA over the past few decades. The decline in the number of marriages and the increase in the number of divorces suggest that the institution of marriage has become less stable and less valued in American society.", "answer_id": "2TmkQRoQXuqJiAs3JCchT8", "model_id": "cos-clipvit-unlock_vision-448-q80", "metadata": {}}
