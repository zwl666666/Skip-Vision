The RMS velocity is given by the equation:\n\nv\\_RMS = sqrt(3RT / m)\n\nwhere v\\_RMS is the RMS velocity, R is the gas constant, T is the temperature in Kelvin, and m is the mass of a single gas particle.\n\nFrom the image, we can see that both samples have the same number of particles, but the particles in Sample B are larger than those in Sample A. This means that the mass of a single gas particle in Sample B is larger than in Sample A. To find the average kinetic energy, we need to calculate the average velocity of the particles in each sample and then multiply it by the mass of a single gas particle.\n\nFor Sample A, the average velocity is:\n\nv\\_A = sqrt(3RT / m\\_A)\n\nFor Sample B, the average velocity is:\n\nv\\_B = sqrt(3RT / m\\_B)\n\nSince the particles in Sample B are larger, the mass of a single gas particle in Sample B is larger than in Sample A. This means that the average velocity of the particles in Sample B is lower than in Sample A. Therefore, the average kinetic energy of the particles in Sample B is lower than in Sample A.\n\nSince the average kinetic energy is directly proportional to the temperature, Sample A has a higher temperature than Sample B.",
